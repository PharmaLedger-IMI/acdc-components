    Test for missing local.properties file
    Push required arguments + switch to using SFSafariViewController
    
    Passing the same type of command line arguments to the node thread that the android edge client is using.
    Switched to using SFSafariViewController instead of wkwebview as it seems to react better.
    
    Still some issues occur and must be adressed on the main epi-workspace(? maybe):
     - in app/loader there must be a config-constants.json, that is probably created from the config-constants.json.template file in that same folder;
    - there seems to be an issue with related to dsu-seed, which the prevents the web app from loading both from desktop and native client
