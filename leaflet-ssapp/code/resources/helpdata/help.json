    "Question": "Why does my 2D code not give a result?",
    "Answer": " There are multiple reasons why the code on your pack could not be resolved. One of the reasons being that the code is illegible or out of focus for the camera. Please try to scan the code in a well lit place and code clearly visible on the screen. The other reason could be that the product is not a part of the product database of PharmaLedger yet. Please check with the manufacturer if their product is a part of the PharmaLedger yet."
