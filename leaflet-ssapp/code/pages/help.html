                Click on "Scan Pack" and allow the application to use the camera. In a decently lit environment, align
                the
                pack physically to the scanning area and wait for a green indicator and beep sound. Once the pack is
                scanned
                successfully a code appears. Click on the "Product information" button to view the leaflet.

            <psk-accordion-item title="Why does my 2D code not give a result?">
                There are multiple reasons why the code on your pack could not be resolved. One of the reasons being
                that
                the code is illegible or out of focus for the camera. Please try to scan the code in a well lit place
                and code
                clearly visible on the screen. The other reason could be that the product is not a part of the product
                database of PharmaLedger yet. Please check with the manufacturer if their product is a part of the
                PharmaLedger yet.

            <psk-accordion-item title="What does the product status on my app indicate?">
                The product status indicator is used to verify if your pack is issued by the manufacturer. This doesnâ€™t
                certify that the physical pack is authentic but is an assurance that it has been digitally verified and
                is available
                in the manufacturer's database.
